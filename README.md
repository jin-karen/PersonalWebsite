# Karen Jin's Personal Website
A personal website built with HTML and CSS that showcases a little about me and my programming journey.

## To Run:
The website is live at: https://jin-karen.github.io/personalwebsite/ (viewed from the active github-pages link available to the right). It can also be run by cloning the repository and viewing the index.html file in your preferred browser.
